This code has been developed and tested on an i386 workstation running Linux (2.6.16.60) and g++ (3.4.4 and 4.2.4)

This code depends on ROSE 0.9.4a, which is available for free download from

	http://rosecompiler.org/

ROSE 0.9.4a also depends on the BOOST C++ library, version 1.3.7, which is available for free download from:

	http://www.boost.org/

First make sure that the ROSE environment variable points to the build directory of ROSE:

	export ROSE=/usr/local/rose/compileTree


The build process depends on libtool. It works with GNU libtool version 1.5.22.
The process also works with G++ 3.4.4 or 4.2.4.


Building Rosecheckers
---------------------

To build the 'rosecheckers' program, which runs secure coding rules:

	make pgms

To test rosecheckers on the code samples from the CERT C Secure Coding Rules:

	make tests

To build API documentation pages, you must have doxygen installed:

	make doc

To clean documentation pages and build files:

	make clean


Running Rosecheckers
----------------

To run the rosecheckers program on a C or C++ source file, simply pass the file as an argument:

	rosecheckers hello.c

If the file takes special arguments to compile properly, such as an include path, simply pass to rosecheckers the same arguments you would pass to GCC or G++.

If the C file violates some secure coding rules, the rosecheckers program will print them out. If the rosecheckers program can not find any violations, it prints nothing.
